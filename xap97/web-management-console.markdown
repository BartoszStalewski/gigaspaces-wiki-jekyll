{% summary %}The web management console is a new user interface for XAP allowing users to deploy, manage and monitor their Processing Units and Applications{% endsummary %}

# Overview

The XAP web management console is a web application which was designed to enable XAP users to quickly understand the state of a running XAP cluster and monitor the running components, i.e. physical hosts, JVMs and deployed processing units.

In terms of functionality, it does not currently replace the existing standalone GUI (the GigaSpaces Management Center), but rather completes it. {% children %}
