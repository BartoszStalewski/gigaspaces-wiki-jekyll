GigaSpaces XAP.NET is packaged as a standard Windows Installer package (.msi file). To start the installation simply double-click the msi file, and the installation wizard will pop up and guide you through the installation process.

Once you accept the licence agreement, you will be asked to choose a setup type. Select 'Complete' to install all the features in the default path (C:\GigaSpaces\XAP.NET {%currentversion%}). Selecting 'Custom' will allow you to customize the installation path, which features will be installed, and more.

## Other Installation Options

- Command-line installation.
- Packaging XAP.NET in another installation package.
- Side-by-side installations.
- Using a different jvm.
