# Wiki File Structure

The wiki has the following directory structure :


##  attachment_files

This directory contains all images and icons that are used throughout the wiki.
At the presnet time all images from the old wiki have been saved in this directory. As we keep improving
the wiki we will restructure the images by logically grouping them in sub folders. This will make it easier
to reuse the images in the future. We started the re grouping with the folder space_operations.
