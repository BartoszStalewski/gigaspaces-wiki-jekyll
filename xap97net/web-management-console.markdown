{summary}The web management console is a new user interface for XAP allowing users to deploy, manage and monitor their Processing Units and Applications{summary}

# Overview

The XAP web management console is a web application which was designed to enable XAP users to quickly understand the state of a running XAP cluster and monitor the running components, i.e. physical hosts, JVMs and deployed processing units.

In terms of functionality, it does not currently replace the existing Java-based GUI (the GigaSpaces Management Center), but rather completes it. {children}
