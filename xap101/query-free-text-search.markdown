Free text search is required almost with every application.
Users placing some free text into a form and later the system allows users to search for records that includes one or more words within a free text field.
A simple way to enable such a search without using a regular expression query that my have some overhead can be done by using an array or a collection of String.

# Example

Our Space class includes the following - note the **words** and the **freeText** fields:

{% highlight java %}
public class MyData {
	String[] words;
	String freeText;

	public String[] getWords() {
		return words;
	}

	public void setWords(String words[]) {
		this.words=words;
	}

	public String getFreeText() {
		return freeText;
	}
	public void setFreeText(String freeText) {
		this.freeText = freeText;
		this.words = freeText.split(" ");
	}
....
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% note %} Note how the **freeText** field is broken into the **words** array before placed into the indexed field.
{%endnote%}

You may write the data into the space using the following:

{% highlight java %}
MyData data = new MyPOJO(...);
data.setFreeText(freetext);
gigaspace.write(data);
{% endhighlight %}

You can query for objects having the word **hello** as part of the freeText field using the following:

{% highlight java %}
MyData results[] = gigaspace.readMultiple(new SQLQuery<MyData>(MyData.class, words[*]='hello'));
{% endhighlight %}

You can also execute the following to search for object having the within the freeText field the word **hello** or **everyone**:

{% highlight java %}
MyData results[] = gigaspace.readMultiple(new SQLQuery<MyData>(MyData.class, words[*]='hello' OR words[*]='everyone'));
{% endhighlight %}

With the above approach you avoid the overhead with regular expression queries.


# Indexing

To speed up the query you can create an [index](./indexing-collections.html) on the fields you want to search.

Example:

{% highlight java %}
public class MyData {
	String[] words;
	String freeText;

	@SpaceIndex (path="[*]")
	public String[] getWords() {
		return words;
	}

	public void setWords(String words[]) {
		this.words=words;
	}

	public String getFreeText() {
		return freeText;
	}
	public void setFreeText(String freeText) {
		this.freeText = freeText;
		this.words = freeText.split(" ");
	}
....
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% refer %}
The same approach can be implemented also with the [SpaceDocument](./document-overview.html).
{% endrefer %}

{% comment %}
To search for specific words in a specific order within the free text field you should use the indexed field and regular expression with another field that stores the free text.

# Regular Expressions

You can query the space using the SQL `like` operator or [Java Regular Expression](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/{%version java-version%}/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) Query syntax.

When using the SQL `like` operator you may use the following:
`%` - match any string of any length (including zero length)
`_` - match on a single character

{% highlight java %}
SQLQuery<MyClass> query = new SQLQuery<MyClass>(MyClass.class,"name like 'A%'")
{% endhighlight %}

Querying the space using the Java Regular Expression provides more options than the SQL `like` operator. The Query syntax is done using the `rlike` operator:

{% highlight java %}
// Match all entries of type MyClass that have a name that starts with a or c:
SQLQuery<MyClass> query = new SQLQuery<MyClass>(MyClass.class,"name rlike '(a|c).*'");
{% endhighlight %}

All the supported methods and options above are relevant also for using `rlike` with `SQLQuery`.

{%comment%}
{% note %} `like` and `rlike` queries are not using indexed data, hence executing such may be relatively time consuming compared to other queries that do leverage indexed data. This means the space engine iterate the potential candidate list to find matching object using the Java regular expression utilizes. A machine using 3GHz CPU may iterate 100,000-200,000 objects per second when executing regular expression query. To speed up `like` and `rlike` queries make sure your query leveraging also at least one indexed field to minimize the candidate list. Running multiple partitions will also speed up the query execution since this will allow the system to iterate over the potential matching objects in a parallel manner across the different partitions.

# Case Insensitive Query

Implementing case insensitive queries can be done via:

- `like` operator or `rlike` operator. Relatively slow. Not recommended when having large amount of objects.
- Store the data in lower case and query on via lower case String value (or upper case)
